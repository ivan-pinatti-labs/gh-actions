"""Behaviour tests for the pin-only check, ported from docker-torrent-box-with-vpn.

That repository's copy of the check is the one that differs most from the rest:
it strips the action SHA and the image digest where every other copy
substitutes a placeholder, and it keeps the digest and version grammars running
inside a workflow's block scalars while skipping only the action ones. So it is
also the only place the `digest_strip`, `action_sha_strip`,
`bare_action_version_strip`, `action_ref_version` and `version` grammars were
ever exercised. Adopting the shared library there would delete this suite with
the script, so it moved here first.

Thirty of these cases have no counterpart in the suite ported from rsync-crypt,
and they are the ones covering those five grammars: an image version and digest
moving together in `.env.example`, a floating tag, a pip floor in
`tests/requirements.txt`, a first time digest pin, and the disguises each of
those invites.

This is the check that stands between a dependency bot's pull request and an
unattended merge, so what it refuses matters as much as what it accepts. The
refusal cases below are the ones that would otherwise turn "approve because the
author is renovate[bot]" into write access to main.
